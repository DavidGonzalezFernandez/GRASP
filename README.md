# GRASP Video Code Repository

## Overview
This repository contains the source code for generating an illustrative video showcasing the GRASP (Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure) algorithm in action, specifically applied to solving a Traveling Salesman Problem.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this video is to serve as a visual aid during a presentation I gave during the Metaheuristics course I took at university. It offers a step-by-step walkthrough of the GRASP algorithm's execution over one iteration, highlighting the dynamic effects that altering the alpha value can have on the solution.

## Dependencies
To generate the video successfully, the code relies on [Manim Comunity Edition](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim) version 0.17.3 for rendering the animations.
